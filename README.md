# How to run basic STV predictions for a jurisdiction
This repo contains basic template files and libraries for running basic STV predictions.

To run a simulation, duplicate the `template_simulation_file.py` file and rename it. Set the Global Variables to your desired values and then run the file using `python -u [your file name]` or using your Python IDE. The output will be printed and stored in `[your file name].csv`.
